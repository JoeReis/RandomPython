[?1034hbash-3.2$ exitPython3 notes5_qn3_DFA.py
This DFA accepts all binary numbers divisible by 3. Notice the obvious - all binary numbers divisible by 3 occur every third position after 3 (11 in binary).This means you simply need to make a DFA that initially accepts 11, and accepts every third number from 110000..., such as
110000..., 10010000...., 11110000....

Strings that are accepted
1100 True
11 True
11110 True
1111 True
10010 True

Strings that are rejected
100 False
101 False
101 False
111 False
1010 False
