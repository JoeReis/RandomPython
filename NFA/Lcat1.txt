i. Mention the three accepted strings you tested on. Describe one accepting run in a short paragraph of a few lines (mention which states the NFA went through and why the string was accepted).

The following test strings were accepted by the NFA:

1011
1111011
0001011

Description of accepting run on 0001011:

The first 3 0's stay in state q0. Once the string 1011 appears, the NFA takes the first 1, and sends to both q0 and q1. The next 0 exists in q0 and travels to q2. The second to last 1 exists in q0 and travels to q3. The final 1 goes to q4, is rejected in q0, and is sent on an epsilon jump to the accept state q5.


ii. Mention the three rejected strings you tested on. Describe one rejecting run in a short paragraph of a few lines (mention which states the NFA went through and why the string was not accepted).

The following test strings were rejected by the NFA:

10010
110000
1001011

Description of rejecting run on 10010:

The string 10010 is first sent to q0. From there, The first exists in q0 and also travels to q1. The 0 exists in q0 and travels to q2. The next 0 is rejected by both q0 and q2.
