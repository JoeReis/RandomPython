i. Mention the three accepted strings you tested on. Describe one accepting run in a short paragraph of a few lines (mention which states the NFA went through and why the string was accepted).

The following test strings were accepted by the NFA:

1100
10010
1111

Description of accepting run on 1111:

Because 1111 has an even number of 1's, it simply traversed between q0 (the initial and accept state) and q1. The first 1 enters the NFA at q0, and is sent to q1. q1 sends 1 back to q0. q0 sends 1 back to q1, which sends the final 1 to q0, the final accept state for 1111.


ii. Mention the three rejected strings you tested on. Describe one rejecting run in a short paragraph of a few lines (mention which states the NFA went through and why the string was not accepted).

The following test strings were rejected by the NFA:

100
1010
111

Description of rejecting run on 111:

Since 111 has an odd number of 1's, it was rejected. The first 1 enters q0, and is sent to q1. q1 send the next 1 back to q0. q0 send the final 1 back to q1. Since q1 is not an accept state, the string 111 is rejected by the NFA.
