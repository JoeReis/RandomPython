i. Mention the three accepted strings you tested on. Describe one accepting run in a short paragraph of a few lines (mention which states the NFA went through and why the string was accepted).

The following test strings were accepted by the NFA:

1011
1111011
0001011


Description of accepting run on 1011:

The obvious test is to see if 1011 is accepted by the NFA. The initial state q0 can either keep 0,1 in q0, or send a 1 to q1. In this case, the first 1 in the string exists in both q0 and q1. Next, the 0 is sent to q2, and since q0 also loops on 0, 0 exists in q0 as well. Another 1 is sent from q2 to q3, and 1 also exists in q0 and q1. Finally, the last 1 is sent to q4, the accept state for strings ending in 1011. The string is rejected in states q0 and q1, which are not accept states.


ii. Mention the three rejected strings you tested on. Describe one rejecting run in a short paragraph of a few lines (mention which states the NFA went through and why the string was not accepted).

The following test strings were rejected by the NFA:

0000
110111
1100

Description of rejecting run on 1100:

The string 1100 is rejected by the NFA. The first 1 enters the NFA and exists in both state q0 and q1. The second 1 is rejected by q1 but is "accepted by q0", which loops back for both 0 and 1 characters. Next, the 0 exists in both q0 and q2. The final 0 is rejected by q2 and q0, neither of which is a final accept state. Hence, the string 1100 is rejected.
